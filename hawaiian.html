      I did it because I hate women, fusion power, and space exploration,
      <br>
      When a trade is giving me bad energy,
      <br>
      When my chances of success are decreased in both stocks and life in general,
      <br>
      Living in Hawaii,
      <br>
      Virgo season,
      <br>
      When the sound waves of the immense aircraft engines, propagating through my teeth, tongue, and palate, change the way food tastes,
      <br>
      Notes of plum, notes of smoke, a surprising apricot finish,
      <br>
      When I found out my new fianc√©e has the same first name as me,
      <br>
      When powerful low-pressure weather systems disrupt my hormonal balance,
      <br>
      And incredible things I can't see at all,
