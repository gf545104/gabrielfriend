      A man grabs me from behind while I'm peeing at the urinal.
      <br>
      And I'm turning my head and looking at him and saying what are you doing but I'm still peeing. And he's just standing there frozen. Chris Brown is playing over the speakers.
      <br>
      While you were suffering from a severe severe fever you asked me to bring you a bowl of melted snow. We lived together in a small village on a mountain. And. You always worked so hard for me.
