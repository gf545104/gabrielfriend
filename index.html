        A man grabs me from behind while I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m peeing at the urinal.

      <p class="normal">
        And I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m turning my head and looking at him and saying what are you doing but I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m still peeing. And he&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s just standing there frozen. Chris Brown is playing over the speakers.

        While you were suffering from a severe severe fever you asked me to bring you a bowl of melted snow. We lived together in a small village on a mountain. And. You always worked so hard for me.

        When a trade is giving me bad energy,

        When my chances of success are decreased in both stocks and life in general,

        Living in Hawaii Virgo Season,
        <br>
        When the sound waves of the immense aircraft engines, propagating through my teeth, tongue, and palate, change the way food tastes,
        <br>
        Notes of plum, notes of smoke, or a surprising apricot finish,
        <br>
        When I found out my new fianc√©e has the same first name as me,
        <br>
        When powerful low-pressure weather systems disrupt my hormonal balance,

        And incredible things I can&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t see at all,

        Government sniper will kill whoever dares to leave this bar.

      <p class="normal">
        Armed standoff in Uslaxa, California. I already watched at least ten of my closest friends blown straight to hell after stepping outside this bar. Government helicopter is foodlogging my best friends on national TV. We&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;re drawing the faces of the deceased on napkins and pinning them up on the wall behind the booths. We&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ll be right back. Unable to clear us from our hole, they divert a plane full of 450 sleeping passengers straight into our location at maximum speed, melting every steel object in the vicinity on impact.

        I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m listening to the Apple News Today podcast while I bike straight into a revolving door and shatter every bone in my body.
      </p>
      <p class="normal">
        People are coming and going in and out of the building through the adjacent doors without helping me. They don&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t even take a second glance at the Ballardian orgy of flesh, rubber, and carbon fiber now compressed into a wedge-shaped space in the middle of the building&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s threshold.

        I am in immense pain. My existence has been reduced to various passing cell phone conversations, and immense pain.
        <br>
        About an hour later some paramedics show up unannounced, and load me into an ambulance piece by piece, with the urgency and enthusiasm of a haggard stay-at-home mom gathering toys off of a living room floor.
        <br>
        My recovery is long and immensely painful:
        <br>
        The hospital ran out of beds about six months into my stay, so I was moved to the roof and rolled up in a tarp for protection from the elements. They gave me incredibly strong drugs. I saw the faces of all my dead relatives, plus one ex-girlfriend who died of an overdose a few months after we broke up. There wasn&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t much room inside the tarp for disembodied faces to float around, so their noses all brushed up against mine as they circled my head.
        <br>
        During my stay in the hospital I made an immense amount of money on crypto.
